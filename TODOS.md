# 🧠 Project TODO List

## 🛍️ Products & Filters

1. **Fix Featured Products Filter**

   * URL: `http://localhost:3000/products?featured=true`
   * Currently showing all products — make sure filtering by `featured=true` works properly.

2. **Footer Links Not Working**

   * Links to fix:

     * `Find Store`
     * `New & Featured`
     * `Best Sellers`
     * `Sale`
   * Add correct routing and pages or filters for these.

3. **Fix Product Page Search Reload**

   * When typing in search, page reloads.
   * Make it a **live search** (client-side filtering, no reload).

4. **Fix Filter Reload on Apply Filter**

   * Product filters are working but trigger a full reload — switch to **client-side filter logic**.

6. **Fetch Real User Orders**

   * Show orders from database using Supabase (user-specific).
   * Create **Order Details Page** to show order summary and items.

7. **Fix “Invalid Date” Issue in Account Profile**

   * “Member since Invalid Date” → properly format user’s `created_at` date.

   * Test flow with live & test keys.
